# GEG6230 - Advanced Geospatial Science - Assignment 1 & 2

## Data visualisation project (Assignment 1)

- Contact: Stuart Grieve (s.grieve@qmul.ac.uk)
- Credit: 45% module mark (6.75 credits)
- Page limit: 1 A3 page
- Deadline: TBD, via QMplus

You are working as a GIS analyst and have been instructed by your client to assist in the identification of suitable hydro power sites across the Lake District. A number of candidate catchments have been proposed but the client does not understand the data about each catchment as they have never done a GIS course.

Create a one page visualisation, highlighting **some** of the information provided by the client in a more accessible manner. **Your final visualisation should include 2 maps and 2 graphs.**

There are 4 catchments, each with a unique number: `75001, 75004, 75006, 75007`

The following data is available on QMplus for each catchment:

- DEM
- Shapefile boundary
- Landcover statistics
- River daily flow measurements over time
- Precipitation over time
- Day and night temperature over time

There is also a general DEM of the area containing all of the catchments, called `Lake_District.tif`.

If you wish, you can find additional information about these catchments from the [National River Flow Archive](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/search), using the unique catchment numbers to find the 4 catchments we are interested in.

Factors which may make a catchment good for a hydro power scheme:

- Steep slopes
- High rainfall and discharge
- Consistent rainfall and discharge over the year
- Landcover types which are conducive to high runoff
- Temperatures usually above freezing

**Note that which catchments you choose is unimportant, this assignment will be graded based on the presentation of the data, not the identification of the best catchments for hydro power.**

## Data visualisation presentation (Assignment 2)

- Contact: Stuart Grieve (s.grieve@qmul.ac.uk)
- Credit: 10% module mark (1.5 credits)
- Time limit: 5 minutes
- Deadline: Week 5's class **(16th October 15:00-18:00)**

Having created your one page visualisation for assignment 1, present this visualisation to the class. You should explain:

- What data you chose to present and why
- What design choices you have made
- What challenges you overcame to present the data

**You are expected to speak for no more than 4 minutes, with 1 further minute used for questions from the audience.**

## Feedback

You will be given time in class to begin this assignment, where you will be able to discuss your ideas with Stuart, as well as your classmates.

Until the end of Week 3, **Friday 4th of October at 5pm**, students can meet with Stuart to receive feedback and discuss their plans and progress.

These meetings can occur during Stuart's Advice and Feedback hours (without an appointment):

- Tuesday 14:00-15:00
- Thursday 10:00-11:00

Or at any other time by appointment, email Stuart (s.grieve@qmul.ac.uk) to arrange one.
