title: Creating Functions
---

At this point, we've written code to explore our data, and start to visualise it.
But, our code is getting pretty long and complicated;
what if we had thousands of datasets,
and didn't want to generate a figure for every single one?
Commenting out the figure-drawing code is a nuisance.
Also, what if we want to use that code again,
on a different dataset or at a different point in our program?
Cutting and pasting it is going to make our code get very long and very repetitive,
very quickly.

We'd like a way to package our code so that it is easier to reuse,
and Python provides for this by letting us define things called 'functions' ---
a shorthand way of re-executing longer pieces of code.
Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_celsius` that converts temperatures
from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

~~~
def fahr_to_celsius(temp):
    return ((temp - 32) * (5/9))
~~~
{: .language-python}

![The Blueprint for a Python Function](../fig/python-function.png)


The function definition opens with the keyword `def` followed by the
name of the function (`fahr_to_celsius`) and a parenthesized list of parameter names (`temp`). The
[body]({{ page.root }}/reference/#body) of the function --- the
statements that are executed when it runs --- is indented below the
definition line.  The body concludes with a `return` keyword followed by the return value.

When we call the function,
the values we pass to it are assigned to those variables
so that we can use them inside the function.
Inside the function,
we use a [return statement]({{ page.root }}/reference/#return-statement) to send a result
back to whoever asked for it.

Let's try running our function.

~~~
fahr_to_celsius(32)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This command should call our function, using "32" as the input and return the function value.

In fact, calling our own function is no different from calling any other function:
~~~
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(32), 'C')
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_celsius(212), 'C')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water: 0.0 C
boiling point of water: 100.0 C
~~~
{: .output}

We've successfully called the function that we defined,
and we have access to the value that we returned.


## Composing Functions

Now that we've seen how to turn Fahrenheit into Celsius,
we can also write the function to turn Celsius into Kelvin:

~~~
def celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c):
    return temp_c + 273.15

print('freezing point of water in Kelvin:', celsius_to_kelvin(0.))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
freezing point of water in Kelvin: 273.15
~~~
{: .output}

What about converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin?
We could write out the formula,
but we don't need to.
Instead,
we can [compose]({{ page.root }}/reference/#compose) the two functions we have already created:

~~~
def fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f):
    temp_c = fahr_to_celsius(temp_f)
    temp_k = celsius_to_kelvin(temp_c)
    return temp_k

print('boiling point of water in Kelvin:', fahr_to_kelvin(212.0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
boiling point of water in Kelvin: 373.15
~~~
{: .output}

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-larger chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown here --- typically half a dozen
to a few dozen lines --- but they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Tidying up

Now that we know how to wrap bits of code up in functions,
we can make our plotting from earlier a bit easier to re-use:

~~~
def morning_temp_plot(filename):

    catchment_id = filename.split('/')[2].split('_')[0]

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',', skiprows=1)

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.plot(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], linestyle='--', color='orange', linewidth=1, label='Maximum Temperatures')
    plt.plot(data[:, 0], data[:, 2], linestyle='-', color='b', linewidth=1, label='Minimum Temperatures')
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel('Days')
    plt.ylabel('Temperateure in Degrees Celsius')
    plt.title(filename, fontsize=14)
    plt.xlim(0, 100)
    plt.ylim(-7, 12)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.title('Catchment {}'.format(catchment_id))
    plt.savefig('{}_morning_temps.png'.format(catchment_id))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
filenames = glob.glob('data/*/*_temperatures_morning.csv')
for filename in filenames:
    morning_temp_plot(filename)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Wait! Didn't we forget to specify what this function should return? Well, we didn't.
In Python, functions are not required to include a `return` statement and can be used for
the sole purpose of grouping together pieces of code that conceptually do one thing.

By giving our functions human-readable names,
we can more easily read and understand what is happening in the `for` loop.
Even better, if at some later date we want to use either of those pieces of code again,
we can do so in a single line.
