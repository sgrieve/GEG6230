# Module Overview

## Module Aims

The aim of this module is to develop an understanding of the implementation and application of cutting edge geospatial analysis and visualisation techniques. We will focus on understanding how to analyse geospatial data efficiently, for a range of applications. Another focus will be on the effective communication of geospatial data and their analysis outputs, to a broad range of audiences. We will examine the integration of raster and vector data in complex geospatial analyses and develop an understanding of how to construct such analyses independently. This module will teach computational skills in the context of the implementation and application of geospatial analysis techniques, and will be valuable to students who wish to develop these skills for their future careers.

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module students will be able to demonstrate:

- An understanding of how to appropriately apply geospatial analysis techniques in a range of contexts
- An understanding of how to present spatial information in a compelling manner
- Computational, statistical and visualisation techniques
- Knowledge of the implementation and application of complex geospatial analysis techniques
- Logical thinking and problem solving
- Good quality technical writing
- Self-learning and collaborative skills whilst writing and understanding algorithms and computer code
- An ability to review current literature, drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives

# Covid Statement

This is an extremely stressful time for all of us, and I am particularly aware of how difficult the last few months will have been for many of you. I am extremely concerned about the safety of my loved ones and I assume that you will share many of these worries.

When I developed this class, it was designed around a lot of in-person interaction, 1:1 teaching and collaboration. Clearly this is not possible in the way that I had originally planned, however I am committed to your learning experience, and to making your online learning as effective and enjoyable as possible. I ask that we all treat each other with patience and kindness, not everything I try will work, and I anticipate there will be a lot of as yet unforeseen challenges that we will all face this semester.

Now more than ever, I value your feedback and ideas on how the class is going - my (virtual) door is always open. And if you are struggling with any aspect of the class, please let me know - the sooner I am aware of a problem the sooner we can find a solution.

# Contact Hours and Attendance

**Lectures/Practicals:** 33 hours

**Dedicated office Hours:** 11 hours

**Independent study**: 120 hours

All teaching for this course will take place online via Blackboard Collaborate. Each week there is a 3 hour timetabled session. On some weeks this will consist of a lecture, followed by a practical to be completed independently by the students. In other weeks, the session will be an interactive live coding lesson. Each week, in addition to these 3 timetabled hours, there will be a dedicated class office hour, also held on Blackboard Collaborate, where students can get 1:1 or small group feedback and help with class material.

Lectures in this course are integrated with practical work, and build week to week so skipping a class will impact your ability to pass the course. It is your responsibility to catch up on any material you have missed prior to the next class.

# QMplus

QMplus will be used to provide lecture and practical materials in advance of each class. Data which will be used in practical work and assessments will be provided on QMplus. Recordings of online classes will be posted online shortly after each week's session.

# Reading

The following texts provide detailed information on many of the concepts and techniques presented throughout this course. Further reading and references will be highlighted during each class.

- Burrough, P., McDonnell, R. and Lloyd, C. (2015). Principles of geographical information systems. Third Edition.
- Tufte, E. (2001). The visual display of quantitative information. Second Edition.
- Monmonnier, M. (2018). How to lie with maps. Third edition.

There are copies of all of these books in the Mile End Library. In all three cases older versions of these books are also available, and are still suitable to refer to.

**Where specific chapters are assigned as readings, pdfs will be posted on QMplus.**

# Assessment

This module is assessed solely via coursework. Full details for each of these assessments will be provided in class and on QMplus.

## Assignment 1

**Data visualisation project:** Given a series of geographic datasets, design a single page combination of graphs and maps to effectively communicate the data to a non-expert audience.

**Assessment weighting:** 50%

**Page limit:** 1 A3 page + 500 words

**Deadline:**

## Assignment 2

**GIS project:** Complete a series of GIS tasks, compiling the results into a brief report.

**Assessment weighting:** 50%

**Page limit:** 5 A4 pages + code

**Deadline:**

Full Coursework Submission Guidelines, details of Penalties for Late Submission and information on how to make an application to the School of Geography’s Extenuating Circumstances Panel can be found in the Guide for Undergraduate Students 2020-21 (the “red book”) which is available as a PDF on the QMplus Landing Page for the School of Geography.

# Feedback

Feedback and provisional marks for coursework will be returned within 4 term-time weeks of submission. Informal feedback will be provided to both the class and on a 1:1 basis during each week's scheduled class and students are encouraged to make use of office hours to get further feedback on their progress.

# Acting on Feedback from Last Year

Each year, we gather feedback from students on our courses, as well as get feedback from other staff in the department and from our external examiners. In the last year, aside from the work to move the class online I have made the following changes to the module:

- Removed a presentation assessment
  - Students felt that the week spent on presentations could have been better spent learning in other ways.
- Added dedicated office hour
  - Last year we had 2 dedicated office hours, one before each assessment. These were very popular, so I am running them every week during the module.
- Making readings more available
  - Students couldn't always get a copy of readings from the library. I have requested more hard copies be purchased and will post PDF scans of readings on QMplus.
- More python AND more ArcMap
  - Some students wanted more Python and less ArcMap, others wanted the reverse. My plan this year is to have more of both, partly enabled by removing the presentation assessment.
- QMplus now organised by week rather than topic
  - Students struggled to find things on the QMplus page. This year everything will be organised into weeks rather than topics to make things easier to find.
- Provide more self-study exercises for Python
  - I will be writing additional exercises to supplement the ones already available
- I'm too nice with feedback
  - Some students felt that my feedback was not critical enough - I will endeavour to provide more clear criticisms in feedback, tied to ways to improve your work in future.
