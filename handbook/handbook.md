# Module Overview

## Module Aims

The aim of this module is to develop an understanding of the implementation and application of cutting edge geospatial analysis and visualisation techniques. We will focus on understanding how to analyse geospatial data efficiently, for a range of applications. Another focus will be on the effective communication of geospatial data and their analysis outputs, to a broad range of audiences. We will examine the integration of raster and vector data in complex geospatial analyses and develop an understanding of how to construct such analyses independently. This module will teach computational skills in the context of the implementation and application of geospatial analysis techniques, and will be valuable to students who wish to develop these skills for their future careers.

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module students will be able to demonstrate:

- An understanding of how to appropriately apply geospatial analysis techniques in a range of contexts
- An understanding of how to present spatial information in a compelling manner
- Computational, statistical and visualisation techniques
- Knowledge of the implementation and application of complex geospatial analysis techniques
- Logical thinking and problem solving
- Good quality technical writing
- Self-learning and collaborative skills whilst writing and understanding algorithms and computer code
- An ability to review current literature, drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives


# Contact Hours and Attendance

**Lectures/Practicals:** 30 hours

**Independent study**: 120 hours

Attendance at lectures and practicals is compulsory and will be monitored. If for some reason you are unable to attend lectures or practicals you should telephone the School of Geography and leave a message on 020 7882 8200.

Lectures in this course are integrated with practical work, and build week to week so skipping a class will impact your ability to pass the course. It is your responsibility to catch up on any material you have missed prior to the next class.

# QMplus

QMplus will be used to provide lecture and practical materials in advance of each class. Data which will be used in practical work and assessments will be provided on QMplus. **Note that Room 1.23 in the Bancroft building does not have QReview facilities, so lectures cannot be recorded.**

# Reading

The following texts provide detailed information on many of the concepts and techniques presented throughout this course. Further reading and references will be highlighted during each class.

- Burrough, P., McDonnell, R. and Lloyd, C. (2015). Principles of geographical information systems. Third Edition.
- Tufte, E. (2001). The visual display of quantitative information. Second Edition.
- Monmonnier, M. (2018). How to lie with maps. Third edition.

There are copies of all of these books in the Mile End Library, and an ebook version of Burrough et al. available on the library website. In all three cases older versions of these books are also available, and are still suitable to refer to.

# Assessment

This module is assessed solely via coursework. Full details for each of these assessments will be provided in class and on QMplus.

## Assignment 1

**Data visualisation project:** Given a series of geographic datasets, design a single page combination of graphs and maps to effectively communicate the data to a non-expert audience.

**Assessment weighting:** 45%

**Page limit:** 1 A3 page

**Deadline:** 2pm 14/11/19

## Assignment 2

**Data visualisation presentation:** Present your map to the class, demonstrating the design choices you have made and the conclusions you have drawn.

**Assessment weighting:** 10%

**Time limit:** 5 minutes

**Deadline:** 2pm 14/11/19

## Assignment 3

**GIS project:** Complete a series of GIS tasks, compiling the results into a brief report.

**Assessment weighting:** 45%

**Page limit:** 4 A4 pages + code

**Deadline:** 2pm 12/12/19

Full Coursework Submission Guidelines, details of Penalties for Late Submission and information on how to make an application to the School of Geography’s Extenuating Circumstances Panel can be found in the Guide for Undergraduate Students 2019-20 (the “red book”) which is available as a PDF on the QMplus Landing Page for the School of Geography.

# Feedback

Feedback and provisional marks for coursework will be returned within 4 term-time weeks of submission. Informal feedback will be provided to both the class and on a 1:1 basis during each week's scheduled class and students are encouraged to make use of office hours to get further feedback on their progress.
